# Space Complexity
# also concerned with how much memory/space an algorithm uses. The notation of space complexity is the same, but instead of checking the time of operations, we check the size of the allocation of memory.
def memory(n):
    # Prints "hello world!" n times

    # TIME COMPLEXITY O(n)
    for x in range(n):
        
        # SPACE COMPLEXITY O(1)
        print('Memory')
memory(10)

# O(n) for time complexity but what about space comlexity.
# In memory it does not neeed to store 10 versions of "Memory!" it only nned store one string. O(1)
